# Software Engineer Immersive - Project One #

A solo project in whcih we had to creat a classic grid style game within 1 week.

# POKE-DASH (Frogger) #
Armed with a brief, I had 1 week to make a game which was playable, had auto-generated obstacles and was fun (hopefully). I created a Pokemon themed Frogger game.

## Brief ##
* Render a game in the browser.
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files.
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
* Use Javascript for DOM manipulation.
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it.
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practises).
 
## Built with ##
* HTML 
* CSS
* Vanilla JavaScript
* Git
* GitHub
